# form-designer

Design, read, and normalize SmartCMP Angular form schema JSON only. It does not submit requests or save changes.

## Boundaries

- No submit/approve/status workflows.
- No CMP form writes: no POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, publish, save, or delete.
- Form URLs are read-only source material.

## Workflow

- New form: if the user gave enough fields, do not read CMP or call datasource tools. Build complete `schema_json`, then call `smartcmp_design_form_schema` with `mode=new`.
- Bare form edit URL: inspect only. Call `smartcmp_read_form_schema`; do not design.
- URL plus requested changes: read the source, build a complete replacement schema, then call design with `mode=regenerate`.
- `mode=modify` is only for complete caller-provided JSON or deterministic `catalog_fields_json` insertion into a supplied `schema_json` or `form_url` source. Never call `mode=modify` with only `mode` or only insertion JSON; that would create an incomplete replacement schema. Do not use URL-only `mode=modify` for `value_expressions_json`; read the source and provide a complete replacement schema with `mode=regenerate`.

## General JavaScript Form Extensions

Use this skill for general SmartCMP form JavaScript extension work. The scripts provide generic validation, normalize structure, preserve unknown keys, and warn about JavaScript risk; they must not perform business semantic inference from field labels, expression substrings, or familiar variable names.

Prefer explicit field-level JavaScript for dynamic behavior. When the user asks for computed values, visibility, linkage, validation, or catalog/model reads, generate the requested JavaScript directly under the relevant SmartCMP key, usually `config.value.expression` with `source: "mock"` and `method: "mock"` for computed values. The LLM owns the business meaning of the generated JavaScript; the script layer is not the source of business semantics.

Catalog context is reference/catalog metadata for generating JavaScript, not a fixed synchronization feature. catalog-provided context values are read-only inputs to the generated expression. Do not add projection source values as form fields unless the user explicitly asks to show or edit them. Do not rely on catalog_fields_json to satisfy catalog context needs; use it only when the user explicitly asks to insert or display a SmartCMP standard catalog field.

`value_expressions_json` is an optional compatibility helper for deterministic projection/composition cases that already fit its limited data shape. In plain terms, value_expressions_json is an optional compatibility helper, not the default design path. Do not use value_expressions_json as the default path for general SmartCMP JavaScript work, and do not force a custom JavaScript request into this helper. When using this helper, keep these contracts:

- `value_expressions_json` is always a JSON array string. For one computed target, pass a one-element array.
- A form field is a user-facing/request parameter in `schema.properties`. A source value used only to compute another field is not a form field.
- When the user enumerates fields or gives a field count, pass `requested_fields_json` with exactly those top-level form field keys, in order. Every item must be a non-empty string. This is for any number of fields; do not include source/dependency values used only by `value_expressions_json`. The design tool rejects missing requested fields.
- Exact field-set constraints can be expressed in any wording or language. Infer them from the user's intended scope, not by matching a fixed keyword list. When the user constrains the exact field set or field count, `schema.properties` and `fieldsets` contain exactly those requested form fields.
- `fieldKey` is always the exact requested target field. There is no default target.
- Use `valueType` when the backend requires the submitted parameter type: `string`, `jsonString`, `object`, or `array`. `object`/`array` submit raw structured model values; `jsonString` submits valid JSON text; `string` submits formatted text. If omitted, the tool infers `object` or `array` from an existing target field schema type before falling back to `string`.
- Choose exactly one value shape per request: top-level `fields` for a flat object, or `compose` for the exact nested object/array/string structure the target field should receive. Never send both `fields` and `compose` for the same `fieldKey`.
- `fields` maps unique output labels to source reads and is only a shorthand for flat JSON such as `{"名称":"..."}`. Each item uses a `label` plus either `field` for a catalog alias or `path` for an exact model path. Do not repeat `label` to imply a parent key or group.
- `compose` is the target output structure itself. Plain object keys become literal output keys; source reads must be single-key leaf markers using `field`/`$field`, `path`/`$path`, `$literal`, or `$concat`.
- For any nested, grouped, array, or complex concatenation request, copy the requested output structure into `compose` before resolving source reads. Decompose complex output into leaf source reads, then combine those leaves with the surrounding JSON structure or `$concat`.
- When the final target value is a single formatted string, use one top-level `$concat` containing literal text and source marker leaves. Do not model that final string as a plain object unless the user explicitly asks for JSON object output.
- Do not invent helper metadata, placeholders, or alternate mini-languages inside `value_expressions_json`; if a key is not one of the supported source markers, the tool treats it as output data.
- Source reads use `field`/`$field` for known catalog aliases with fallback candidate paths, or `path`/`$path` for exact model paths with no parent-path fallback.
- Do not add source/dependency values as form fields unless the user explicitly asks to show or edit those values.
- Preserve requested visibility. Value-expression target fields preserve the requested schema shape. Do not default value-expression target fields to hidden, titleless, or non-editable.
- Return an empty string until at least one source value resolves.

Only these catalog aliases are supported: `name`/`名称`, `owners`/`所有者`, `projects`/`应用系统`, `businessGroup`/`业务组`.

For custom JavaScript, provide a complete function string under `config.value.expression` with `source: "mock"` and `method: "mock"`. The design tool rejects literal ellipsis placeholder JavaScript. Keep Chinese labels as literal UTF-8 text, not Unicode escape sequences.

## Common Widget Contracts

Use the SmartCMP widget shape, not generic web-control names:

- Text input: `type: "string"` with `widget.id: "string"`.
- Number input: `type: "number"` with `widget.id: "number"` and range validation when known.
- Checkbox: `type: "boolean"` with `widget.id: "checkbox"`.
- Select: `type: "string"`, `format: "uiselect"`, `widget.id: "select"`, and `default: null` when a placeholder should show.
- Multi-select: `type: "array"` or `type: "string"`, `format: "uiselect"`, `widget.id: "select"`, plus `selectMode: "multiple"`.
- Static options: use field-level `selectDatas` with display labels and stored values; do not hide option data inside `widget`.
- Tables: top-level table fields use `type: "array"` with `widget.id: "table-head"`; row schema lives under `items.properties`, and `items.fieldsets` lists row columns.
- User-facing text should prefer `i18nTitle`, `i18nPlaceholder`, and `i18nDescription` when Chinese/English rendering matters.
- Required fields use `required`/`isRequired`; keep `schema.required` consistent when the target renderer expects root required lists.
- Description-only Angular2 schemas still need non-empty `properties`; add a hidden placeholder property instead of returning a schema with only description text.

## Schema Rules

- Root: `type: object` with `properties` and `widget.id: "object"`.
- `properties` and `fieldsets` must match the requested form-field set; computed-value dependencies do not expand that set.
- When adding fields through `catalog_fields_json` or `value_expressions_json`, the generated target fields must also be present in root `fieldsets`.
- Top-level fields: stable `id`, numeric `index`, matching `type`, and `widget.id` (`string`, not `text`, for string inputs).
- Include `config.visibility.allowInRequest` and `allowInApproval` unless the user supplied different visibility.
- Preserve unknown keys, `hidden`, `condition`, `fieldsets`, `selectDatas`, `value`, and `items`.

## Output

Return the exact normalized schema text from `smartcmp_design_form_schema` as a fenced `json` block. All string values inside the returned JSON are opaque. Do not add, remove, rename, move, summarize, or abbreviate any property or string value. Do not summarize, abbreviate, reorder, rename, or replace long JavaScript strings with `...`.

For URL-based regenerate or modify work, state that the result is a replacement schema for manual review and copying. Do not imply that the tool saved, updated, or published the CMP form.
